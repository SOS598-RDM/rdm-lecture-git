#### configuration

For new installations, users will need to establish at least their global `user.name` and `user.email`. See *Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup* in the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for more details.

`git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'`  
`git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'`  
<br>
`git config --global --list`


#### authentication

GitHub's authentication requires users to establish a Personal Access Token (PAT) to enable most GitHub functionality. Please see the GitHub documentation for [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). For R users particularly, but generally as well, Bryan et al's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is an excellent resource for setting up and getting started with GitHub.
