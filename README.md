### SOS 598 Researach Data Management repository housing introduction to Git materials

GitHub's authentication requires users to establish a Personal Access Token (PAT) to enable most GitHub functionality. Please see the GitHub documentation for [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). For R users particularly, but generally as well, Bryan et al's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is an excellent resource for setting up and getting started with GitHub.
